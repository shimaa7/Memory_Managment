# Memory_Managment

Memory Allocation<br />
I. Inputs :<br />
1- User inputs holes sizes and starting addresses.<br />
2- User inputs number of processes.<br />
3- User inputs processes’ size (Ex: p0 size =100, p1 size = 50… etc).<br />
4- User inputs the method of allocation (first fit or best fit).<br />
II. Scenario to be done:<br />
1- Allocate all processes using allocation methodology.<br />
2- De-Allocate a process ( The user choose a process to de-allocate, you should consider its<br />
space as a hole to be used later and add to it any neighboring holes)<br />
III. Output:<br />
Your output is the list of holes and allocated memory blocks (starting addresses and sizes) at<br />
each allocation step (Ex: initial state , after P0 allocation, after P1 allocation, after P2 swapped<br />
out P1 and is allocated instead of P1, … etc.)<br />
